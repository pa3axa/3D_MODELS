## All parts were found on Aliexpress.

The variation in part placement in production i have  
seen is quite big so you either move parts in line with the  
front or adapt the front 3d model.

The manual is not a 100% match for the current versions but  
its still usefull for operation. The VFD_version is a more  
up to date circuit diagram.
